          Based on the user research conducted on end users, we have developed user Personas
          which are helpful in considering brand customers and users' interests , preferences, and weaknesses to help direct decisions about the kind of application design thhat they 
          prefer and this is regarded as part of interaction design. Every project' user research is recorded in the form of user personas to analyse and cater to user needs.
