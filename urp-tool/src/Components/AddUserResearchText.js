        User research helps us understand how people do tasks and achieve targets 
        that are important to them. It provides us with context and insight, and 
        enables us to respond with useful, concise and efficient design solutions.
        Helps us to recognise unarticulated needs and fill in any gaps in our user
        awareness, implementation background, challenges.

        You can add user research findings here.
